# EarthCube

This reposistory has been established to provide a central place to capture information related to the https://www.earthcube.org community and initiative.  Please feel free to file any general [issues](https://github.com/earthcube/earthcube/issues) related to the EC website, projects, software, and they will be moved to the appropriate repository.

The EarthCube office maintains this repository, and will mirror GitHub repositories for EarthCube project products. 


## Github Organization
Proposed Github organization:

* The [EarthCube](https://github.com/earthcube) organization will be used to collect and manage any existing codebases/repositories officially maintained by the Earth Cube Office (ECO).  Projectsin the EarthCube organization repository are expected to have working GitHub releases and documentation to guide users to understand the implemented functionality, how to set up a development environment, and interfaces for integrating EarthCube resources into new applications.
* The [EarthCube Incubator](https://github.com/earthcube-incubator) organization will be used to provide community space for project and award-based repositoriess that don't otherwise have a home. Projects that are in progress should be mirrored here.
