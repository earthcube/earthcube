# EarthCube

This reposistory has been established to provide a central place to capture information related to the [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org) community and initiative. The EarthCube office maintains this repository. Please feel free to file any general [issues](https://github.com/earthcube/earthcube/issues) related to the EC website, projects, software, and they will be moved to the appropriate repository.



## Github Organization
Proposed Github organization:

* The [EarthCube](https://github.com/earthcube) organization will be used to collect and manage any existing codebases/repositories maintained by the Earth Cube Office (ECO) or the appropriate delegated authority.  Projects in the EarthCube organization repository are expected to have at least one working GitHub release package with documentation to guide users to understand the implemented functionality, how to set up a development environment, and interfaces for integrating EarthCube resources into new applications.
* The [EarthCube Incubator](https://github.com/earthcube-incubator) organization will be used to provide community space for project and award-based repositoriess that don't otherwise have a home. Projects that are in progress should be mirrored here.

This readme file is in the master branch of the main earthcube repository for information only. More detailed documentation and information will be maintained at 
[https://earthcube.github.io/earthcube/](https://earthcube.github.io/earthcube/), with content managed in the gh-pages branch of this repository. Activate the gh-pages branch to see the website content.
