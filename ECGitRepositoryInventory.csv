EarthCube Advancing netCDF-CF Project,,EC-netCDF-CF,https://github.com/Unidata/EC-netCDF-CF,EarthCube Advancing netCDF-CF for the Geoscience Community,"EarthCube: Advancing netCDF-CF Project. Project goal is to 1) increase the range of geoscience domains using netCDF-CF and active in the community; 2) extend the netCDF-CF standard to support data from a wider range of geoscience domains; and 3) Collaborate with other standards groups such as the OGC, ESIP, RDA, and NASA ESDS.  The project will gather scientific use-cases and example datasets to guide the drafting of documents detailing enhancements to the CF standard. Close collaboration with the existing netCDF-CF community and engagement with new geoscience domains as well as other standards groups will lead to strong community agreement around the proposed enhancements.  Repo contains proposals for CF conventions.  0 releases.","Aleksandar Jelenak, Ethan Davis, dasantek, Charlie Zender, Tim Whiteaker, Ryan May, Daniel Lee",2018-06-19,git://github.com/Unidata/EC-netCDF-CF.git

Throughput viewer service,,throughput_vue,https://github.com/throughput-ec/throughput_vue,EarthCube Throughput,"Single page application to serve basic Throughput services (direct annotation of a graph element). This application connects to the Throughput annotation graph database. The database itself uses a data model based on the W3C Annotation standard, although modified to fit the graph database model we have developed, and further modified for several use-cases to fit with unser interaction models.",Simon Goring,2020-03-24,
Throughput API,,throughput_api,https://github.com/throughput-ec/throughput_api,EarthCube Throughput,"An express/nodejs API application and skeleton. This application is designed to allow users to generate simple annotations of material using web-based resources based on the API protocols defined in the W3C standards.  Annotations are generated as conformant to W3C annotation standards, and implemented using Neo4J.  Requires Neo4J instance to be available.",Simon Goring,2020-03-24,
