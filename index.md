# EarthCube

This repository has been established to provide a central place to capture information related to the [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org) community and initiative.  Please feel free to file any general [issues](https://github.com/earthcube/earthcube/issues) related to the EC website, projects, software, and they will be moved to the appropriate repository.

The EarthCube office maintains this repository.

Have a look at [Specifications - summary for the geosciences community](https://docs.google.com/document/d/158z6ebbpA_k-oEawZw4xgm527GJGDHVw0Y94cuS0OIk) for current guidelines on ways to make your EarthCube software interoperable.


## Github Organization
Proposed Github organization:

* The [EarthCube](https://github.com/earthcube) organization will be used to collect and manage any existing codebases/repositories officially maintained by the Earth Cube Office (ECO).  Projectsin the EarthCube organization repository are expected to have working GitHub releases and documentation to guide users to understand the implemented functionality, how to set up a development environment, and interfaces for integrating EarthCube resources into new applications.
* The [EarthCube Incubator](https://github.com/earthcube-incubator) organization will be used to provide community space for project and award-based repositoriess that don't otherwise have a home. Projects that are in progress should be mirrored here.

## Known existing organizations/repositories

Several GitHub organizations have been established by the EarthCube office, each associated with a project funded to develop various components of a platform to enable resource registration, discovery, and access using web standard practices and cloud–based technology. A prototype for the platform has been deployed as [GeoCODES](https://www.earthcube.org/geocodes). We are evaluating these organizations and their repositories to consolidate key development components under a single EarthCube organization.

* [EarthCube Architecture - Project 418 organization](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418)
    * Demonstrating HTML5 microdata to publish schema.org metadata on dataset landing pages, and harvest the metadata to drive discovery applications. Development of conventions for using schema.org vocabulary for datasets, and extensions to fill gaps in the vocabulary where necessary. 
* [EarthCube Architecture - Project 418 resource registration user interface](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418gui)
    * Software for a web-based software tool to enable users to generate, validate, and export metadata for datasets or organizations in the JSON-LD format utilizing schema.org vocabulary with conventions and some extensions developed by the P418 team. Design goal is a responsive web tool that is ready for utilization by desktops, laptops, tablets, and smart phones.  Templates for the tool implement a recommended specification based on the vocabulary developed as part of P418 for Schema.org/Organization and Schema.org/Dataset types which includes a variety of important attributes and classes such as contact information, parent organizations, funding agencies, publishing principles, authors, citations, DOIs, spatial coverage, variables measured, and dataset download links and formats.
* https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project419
    * This GitHub organization has no public repositories, documentation, or participants 
* [ESSO office, EarthCube projects](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-ecprojects)
    * includes one repository with code for extracting information from a Trello instance and inserting into a database.
* [EarthCube Resource Registry Project organization](https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-ecresourcereg)
    * Organization includes repositories housing ontology and vocabulary development work for documentation of Earth Science information resources other than Dataset. Product ontology and vocabularies are all registered with the ESIP Community Ontology Repository. Also includes a fork of the p418 Gleaner software used for demonstration implementation of the resource registry. 

### Inventory of EarthCube project repositories

The EarthCube office is updating the EarthCube organization on GitHub. Our goal is that the EC GitHub Organization should host repositories for EarthCube projects and products as a means of branding and providing a location to point people to when they want to know ‘what’s there’?  The GitHub EarthCube Organization would be intended for the more technical/developer EarthCube user, paralleling the EarthCube Tools Inventory, which is intended for the scientist/research user. 

For more information on what we are recommending from Earth Cube Projects, see [EarthCube GitHub Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j5XRXSVjTnPTzmaxuHX3Ce8eVPwTpanh3sSdQPagt94).  A listing of Github repositories created by EarthCube projects, hosting software or other digital resource development to support funded projects is linked below.  The inventory includes repositories hosted by the organizations listed above, as well as projects funded through the EarthCube NSF proposal process.
